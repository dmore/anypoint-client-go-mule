## Methods

### NewWorkerClouds

`func NewWorkerClouds(assigned int32, reassigned int32, ) *WorkerClouds`

NewWorkerClouds instantiates a new WorkerClouds object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewWorkerCloudsWithDefaults

GetAssigned returns the Assigned field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetAssignedOk

### SetAssigned

`func (o *WorkerClouds) SetAssigned(v int32)`

SetAssigned sets Assigned field to given value.

GetReassigned returns the Reassigned field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetReassignedOk
